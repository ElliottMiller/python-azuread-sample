Quick start for getting started with Azure Active Directory in Python

After downloading this sample, you'll just need to do a couple things to get it up and running:

1. Make sure you have an Azure AD directory up and running. If you need help, refer to my blog post: http://www.elliottmiller.me/2015/06/azure-ad-in-django-with-python-social.html
2. If you run it through visual studio, right click on Python Environments and add a new virtual environment. It will install a new environment based on requirements.txt
3. Open up AzureAuthSample/settings.py and input your Key and Secret at SOCIAL_AUTH_AZUREAD_OAUTH2_KEY and SECRET.
4. Done! You're good to go.
